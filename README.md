A Unity3D first person horror game that I made in Game Jam 2014, Edmonton with my team

Enclosure - You only Live Thrice

Brought to you by Eric, Simon, Steven and Tanvir.

You play as a guy in a "university cafeteria" and wants to leave for home, but things aren't exactly as they seem.
Touching things reveals their true form, but he does not realize this and must examine objects and people in the room to find a way out. 
Each "death" will gradually reveal the true nature of things. Death is not necessary to complete the game.
